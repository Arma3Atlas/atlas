Module interface for “objectives”
(Module in programming sense, not arma map module sense)

- Constructor called with its object, the object of its parent ‘town’, initial owner side
- Object getvariable “atlas_objective_draw” call [Object]; tells it to update its markers/tasks/etc.
- Object getvariable “atlas_objective_enable” call [Object, true/false]; to tell it to enable or disable. Usually because the town is no longer in play (no contested neighbors, etc.)
- Object getvariable “atlas_objective_getowner” call [object]; returns current owning side. May return empty string to signify “all” sides, for something that just has to be completed by somebody.
- Object getvariable “atlas_objective_setowner” call [object,”blufor”]; What’s our preferred way to call sides? 
- Calls a function on its parent (parentobject getvariable “atlas_objective_fullfilled” call [parentobject, selfobject, newowner] ) when it has been fulfilled.
Interface will be expanded to account for economy etc.
Any ‘module’ that follows the interface can be slotted in. It also ensures a clean separation of code.

Module “bunker” - our default form of “objective”
- Variables
  “active”, true/false, whether this bunker is capturable at this time. 
  
Constructor / initializer (atlas_obj_bunker_newbunker)
- Called at mission start with parameters as per interface above
- Initial version will be passed a preplaced bunker object. Later, could make its own physical object.
- Sets up initial values for all variables on the bunker
- Sets up interface functions on the object 
- Makes a trigger for the bunker, (repeatable, anyone present) such that a change in population causes a call to UpdatePopulation.
- Makes markers/tasks etc that will show the capture status of that objective.

UpdatePopulation (atlas_obj_bunker_updatepopulation)
- gets called with bunker object by trigger
- The bunkerobject should have a getvariable entry for the trigger, and this function uses list to get the population.
- Notes and stores how many people (from each side) are in its zone
- If no non-owning players are present, reset the capture scores? (game design question)
- If non-owning players are present, starts the process for running UpdateCapturing every 5 seconds.  (Cba timed eventhandler - if present else spawn?)
To check: Does a unit dying inside cause it to trigger, such that killing people inside correctly updates population?

UpdateCapturing (not implemented yet)
- Gets called with the bunker object.
- If there is reason to continue, set itself up to run again in 5 seconds
- Adds ‘capture points’ in whatever form that takes, stored in the bunker object.
- If the capture points reach the threshold of capture, call BunkerCaptured
BunkerCaptured
- Sets ownership of the bunker
- Calls town’s TBD function to notify a change in ownership

Draw (interface)
- The only function that touches the markers/tasks (beyond creating them)
- May be the only function that runs client side?

Save (interface)
- Implemented only much later, if ever
- Stores data to profile, such that it can be loaded back in


Module “Town”
Has its own constants/variables
Variables
“Active”, true/false. 
Neighbor towns
“Bunkers”, array of OBJECT, contains the objects representing the objectives
Constructor
Run at mission start
Sets up initial values for variables
Responsible for calling the constructor of its associated bunkers


Draw
Only function that changes the markers/tasks for the town
Calls draw on its bunker “subobjects”
